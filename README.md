Python Tableau Cloud Workbook & Project Finder

This script uses the tableauserverclient library in Python to access your Tableau Cloud site to:
- Search for projects (folders), based on string search, returning project name and id
- Search for workbooks, based on string search

It's handy for quickly finding a specified project or workbook in your Tableau Cloud environment, or a full list which you can output in any form you like.

So just:
- copy the code
- install TSC
- get your Tableau Cloud Credentials (generate an access token on your account)
- and off you go!

REQUIREMENTS
pip install tableauserverclient as TSC
