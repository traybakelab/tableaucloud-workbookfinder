# Tableau Cloud Project & Workbook Finder

This script uses the tableauserverclient library to access your Tableau Cloud site to:
- Search for projects (folders), based on string search, returning project name and id
- Search for workbooks, based on string search

Just copy and paste the code to start. In addition, you will need to generate an access token on your Tableau account (you will at least need a creator license for this).

REQUIREMENTS
pip install tableauserverclient
